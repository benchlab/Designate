# Designate
Decentralized Naming Service For Bench dApps, Networks, Wallets and Users.

## What Purpose Does Designate Serve?
Designate is very similar to DNS within the central internet. Where DNS correlates a domain name or TLD to a network address. Designate was designed with the same approach of correlation but works dramatically different and expands to help [Aero](https://github.com/benchlab/aero) as a decentralized content delivery network (CDN), by giving HRAs (Human-Readable Addressses) that correlate with network-based objects and network-based entities and their UID's (unique identifiers). This can help with the utilization and correlation of network-based objects and network-based entities by using HRAs, rather than long and hard to remember UIDs. Using HRAs for the retreival of network-based objects (videos, text-files, audio, images, folders, etc) makes life easier on developers and can be used by dApp and website developers who are looking to host on the Bench Network and also helps with the importing of Aero-based objects in their dApps and website code, without the need to write extra code and spend extra time developing their dApp, like it would on other networks that don't have `Decentralized Designation`. 

Although Designate is responsible for the registration of a HRA (Human-readable address) network address, it is not responsible for UID addresses that HRA's correlate to. [Kepler](https://github.com/benchlab/kepler) is responsible for deliving out UIDs to all kinds of network objects, dApps and other things floating across the Bench universe and is responsible for correlating where those objects actually exist or what that address points to. Designate simply points a HRA to a Kepler-based UID, so that's easy for users to remember and utilize, when exploring the Bench Network.

Bench's network has so many moving parts due to its components and its overall purpose. Below are a list of the components that Designate is designed to give human-readable names to access by pointing to their Kepler-based UIDs:

- `objects` - Objects on the Bench Network means videos, text-files, audio, images, folders, etc. <br>
-- `videos` - Video files uploaded to the network via benOS-based dApps.<br>
-- `text-files` - Text files uploaded to the network via benOS-based dApps.<br>
-- `audio` - Audio files uploaded to the network via benOS-based dApps.<br>
-- `image` - Image files uploaded to the network via benOS-based dApps.<br>
-- `folder` - Folder files uploaded to the network via benOS-based dApps.<br>

- `network entities` - Network entities on the Bench Network means networks, computers (nodes), dApps, websites, wallets and accounts. <br>
-- `networkId` - Networks all have a UID. Designate can give them a HRA. <br>
-- `nodeId` - Nodes are computers running benOS. Designate can give those computers HRAs.<br>
-- `dappId` - dApps are decentralized apps on the Bench Network. Designate can give them HRAs.<br>
-- `websiteAddr` - Websites can be hosted on the Bench Network. For easy access via [Telescope](https://github.com/benchlab/telescope), like web addresses of old, Designate can create HRAs for websites. <br>
-- `walletAddr` - Wallets are created via the benOS native dApp [BenchWallet](https://github.com/benchlab/benchwallet) and addresses from even remote networks, can be given an HRA. <br>
-- `accountId` - Every user on the network has a Kepler-generated `accountId`, Designate can give a HRA that correlates to this `accountId`<br>

## Designate-based HRAs for TLDs and File Extensions
Designate and Kepler work together, where Kepler hands out UIDs to everything on the Bench Network and Designate hands out HRAs that point to those UIDs. Designate creates the true `dWeb`, by creating a new TLD system that creates a registration system for decentralized domains that are utilized by websites within the Bench Network and HRAs for File Extensions for files located on the network. The only true downside to a decentralized operating system, is that naming files something other than their auto-generated UIDs, would be to register an HRA for the file. 

For example, lets say you have a picture of your mom and dad and Kepler gives it the UID of `AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDEljglXMulz8404XwUBwbhZoWJmqWEH1IsQb9WN3.jpg` along with the image extension, correlated to the image-type of the image, in this case `.jpg`. You could create a HRA for this image through Designate like `picture-of-mom-and-dad.jpg`. The reason for having to do this, is because a decentralized operating system, doesn't store your files locally, while your local resources my store files of other users locally, you have no access to this data - as you shouldn't. Only the network does. Being that this is the case, there is no "Rename" functionality, when it relates to renaming the name of a file, since Kepler gives it a UID upon creation, so that it can find the location of that file wherever it is in the network. Using Designate, creating a HRA, as long as the HRA hasn't been taken - is possible. 

## Designate Custom TLDs and Extension Names
One of Designate's coolest features is that it gives users the ability to create their own TLDs and Extensions. Don't worry, there is no need to go to iCANN **lol**, custom TLDs and Extension Names can be created instantly and used by anyone at that point, using the Bench Network. To continue with our example from above, lets say you don't want to use the native `.jpg` HRA Extension Name, you could create `.yourname` so that you can create the filename `mom-dad.johndoe`. Even though .johndoe isn't an image file-type, the network realizes that `.johndoe` is a Designate-based HRA and is able to coorlate that to the base UID generated by Kepler at `AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDEljglXMulz8404XwUBwbhZoWJmqWEH1IsQb9WN3.jpg`. This is because Designate is a decentralized naming service but also a decentralized domain name system (DDNS). 

## Designate-CLI
Just like [Kepler](https://github.com/benchlab/kepler), Designate also has it's own CLI, [Designate-CLI](https://github.com/benchlab/designate), used to claim HRAs through Bench Network's Designate service. Below are examples of how you can use Designate-CLI. 

### Designate-CLI Usage

#### Designate Kepler Account
You can easily `designate` an Account HRA by using the Kepler Account UUID Key, not to be confused with the `account_uuid`. The -d flag stands for `designate-name` and `nomoreheroes` in the example below would be the Account HRA being designated. 

```
# designate account 2fd305ea-912c-405b-bfed-7d98143d0d56 -d nomoreheroes
'nomoreheroes' is available and now designated as a premium name for 2fd305ea-912c-405b-bfed-7d98143d0d56
```

#### Designate Dig Designated Account Name 
You can easily `dig` the original Kepler account data that's related to a Designate Account HRA as is shown in the example below. 

```
# designate account dig -d nomoreheroes 

Displaying Kepler account information for designated namespace "nomoreheroes"

## What Is benOS
[benOS](https://github.com/benchlab/benos) is a decentralized operating system, originally based on Linux, uses some design strategies from [RedoxOS](https://github.com/redox-os) and even some design concepts from [OpenStack](https://github.com/openstack), [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and [EOS](https://github.com/eosio). Although we utilize some of their design strategies, benOS is completely custom from a codebase perspective.
